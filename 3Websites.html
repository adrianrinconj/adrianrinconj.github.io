The first website that I saw was the Yale School of Art website. This website was terrible. The reason why this website is terrible is because of the way it looks. It is so disorganized and disoriented in every way possible. This is obviously due to design, but the way that all of the text boxes don't line up, the black on blue fonts, the fonts with white background texts with black fonts made it really disorienting. They do use the new html style however, which really shocked me since it looks like a website from the 90â€™s. It goes to show how much effort they put into their website by using a new doctype in order to emulate a bad website on an old doctype. The colors are used in such a weird way that it is purposeful; colors match their audience. They also use many major colors which might be why it is so disorienting. They do not use tables, but they do use rect in their code. The layout is also jarring as well, as I have no idea what is going on with it. Navigation is also difficult since the boxes are all over the place and they have no order to them. There is also no scroll effect. This website also uses a lot of major colors that are nauseous. Personally, I use a blue light screen so those could make the colors even more harsh for me, but honestly, there seems to be a lot of puke colors. The little things that set it apart is really it's disorganization. One cool little thing that they had (also hurtful to see) is the constantly zooming photo they have towards the middle of the screen. Website is fully functional, just ugly.

  The next website I looked at was SVZ. This website was awesome to interact with. They had a scrolling logo and almost everything in their website was intractable. Whenever you hover over a shape, it starts to move and rotate. The code is clean and modern, and they do not use tables. There also seems to be a scrolling effect and the website does validate. The website is also laid out by div mostly with some script along too. The colors are simplistic in the best way possible. There are 4 or 5 colors total but they are used in such a way that it is pleasing to the eye to look at. The moving shapes also help out a lot as well. I would say that it could match their audience, since it is used so nicely and it is a design company. The little things such as the interactable icons, and the complete black background make this website so appealing. I really enjoy the font as well, as it is a mix between arial and Times New Roman it seems. They also have their images staggered in the middle of the page which gives you a feeling at where you are within the page.

  The last Website that I looked at was the Michael Kors Website. This website was really fun to navigate as well. This website was probably the most well organized one as well which I really appreciated. I like how simplistic the website is as well. It is straight to the point which makes it accessible to anyone and is a quick look. The website is also written within modern html meaning that they use modern html5 elements. There are no tables used either. I can also navigate around it pretty easily due to its simplistic layout, so I would say it is well done. This website only uses a couple main colors and they fit well. They use a beige background with highlights of white and black which seems to fit the Michael Kors brand pretty well. The layout that they use also makes sense to me. They use section and meta in order to organize the website. One little thing that I appreciate about the website is that they have a hover element that turns grey on the buttons after the video. I also like how these buttons are transparent, and they follow you around the screen after you scroll past the video.
