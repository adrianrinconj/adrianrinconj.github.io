<h1> Review of States </h1>

<h2><a href="https://www.maine.gov/portal/index.html">1. Maine</a></h2>
<p>I like the colors and design. It is pleasing and has a nice mix between
something like a tech business and information website. The website
loads quickly, and the menu is easy to navigate. This menu also includes a
search bar. I can find the items easily in the website, and I can use the
search bar to help out. The website also changes its format according
to what size you may put it. This was my favorite website for its mix
of consumer and information design. </p>

<h2><a href="https://www.maryland.gov/Pages/default.aspx">2. Maryland</a></h2>
<p>The design of the website is neat, but I don't much like the layout or colors.
It loads quickly but the links do not as much. The menu is easy to navigate
since it is a bar menu. This website is easy to navigate and is clear in its
sections. I can find what I am looking for easily, there is again a search bar
to help out with that. This website also resizes based on what type of screen size
you choose.</p>

<h2><a href="https://alaska.gov/">3. Alaska</a></h2>
<p>The design of this website most definetly feels like a database. I like This
since I am more familiar with this layout and the color scheme is pleasing. The
website also loads quickly. The menu is easy to navigate aswell. I can find what is
on the website relativley easily, and there is a searchbar. The website does work
for my laptop, however, it does not resize itself if I choose to use multi window
like the previous two did.</p>

<h2><a href="https://portal.arkansas.gov/">4. Arkansas</a></h2>
<p>The design of this website is good. I think that this has the most pleasing
color scheme out of all of the websites. The website loads quickly for me.
The menus are also easy to navigate (it is a bar menu). I can find items in
the website pretty easily, and this website also has a search bar. This website
also reconfigures itself whenever I resize the window. </p>

<h2><a href="https://portal.kansas.gov/">5. Kansas</a></h2>
<p>The design of the website is garbage. I do like the mural in the background,
that at least is pleasing. However the credits are hidden behind the search bar
The website loads quickly for me. The menu... well, I can't find the menu.
For me there is only a search bar. The lack of a menu makes items hard to search
for, but if you know specifically what you are looking for you can find it with
the searchbar. The website does resize for me when I enter windowed view. This
was my least favorite since the website looks lazy and incomplete. I exited out
of it, and reclicked the link since I thought it was a bug. </p>
