        Spring symbolizes youth and a new beginning. Like summer, it also symbolizes youth and innocence. In poetry it is often used to symbolize both love and joy.

        “What a strange thing!
        to be alive
        beneath cherry blossoms.”

        “When spring came, even the false spring, there were no problems except where to be happiest. The only thing that could spoil a day was people and if you could keep from making engagements, each day had no limits. People were always the limiters of happiness except for the very few that were as good as spring itself.”
        ― Ernest Hemingway, A Moveable Feast
