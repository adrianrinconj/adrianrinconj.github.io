  <h1>Web Hosts Review</h1>


  <h2><a href="http://godaddy.com">godaddy.com</a></h2>
  <p> Godaddy's website hosting is the biggest website
    hosting in the world. It has a starting price of "Economy"
    that is $5.99 a month up to a Maximum plan that is $19.99
    a month. The hosting services that it has are 24/7 support,
    SSL Certificate, and Bussiness hosting plans and Wordpress
    Hosting Plans (Wordpress hosting plan has its own seperate
    payment). You can get more than a dozen domain names, and
    hundreds of sub domians aswell.
  </p>

<h3><a href="http://bluehost.com">BlueHost.com</a></h3>
<p>Bluehost's website hosting actually has a sale going on right now.
  It usually makes you pay $8.99 a month, but is going on sale for
  $2.95 a month as of now. This also has the SSL Certificate included,
  with a year free domain thrown in when you sign up. BlueHost is also
  known for having good speed for a web host and has unlimited domain
  hosting.

<h4><a href="http://hostgator.com">hostgator.com</a></h4>
<p>HostGator is also a top competetor for best website hosts.
  It starts off at $2.75 a month at the "Hatchling Plan", and goes
  up to $5.25 a month for the "Bussiness Plan". You also get
  an SSL Certificate with this website, aswell as 24/7 costumer
  service. This website is also uses Shared Hosting, and has more
  than a dozen domains and many more sub-domains that you
  can choose from.
</p>

<h5>My Personal Pick</h5>
  <p>My personal pick out of these three would be HostGator.
  I would choose this because this seems to be the cheapest
  for its highest quality package, and has the most accessibility
  features suck as, one click installers and unmetered storage.
